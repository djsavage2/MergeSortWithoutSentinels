# Mergesort Without Sentinels

This was a "Challenge Question" in my DS&A book from college. Decided to implement it myself and got extra credit for showing it in class. Algorithm is excessively verbose for that reason.

## Usage

You're gonna need [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) for this.

1. Compile:
```
gcc -o mergeSort mergeWithoutSentinels.c
```

2. Run compiled code:
```
mergeSort
```

- or just double-click mergeSort.exe
